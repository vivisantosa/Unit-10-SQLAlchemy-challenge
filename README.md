## Climate Analysis and Exploration
### Precipitation Analysis
Looking at the table below, we can conclude that Hawaii, is a low precepitation area with only a few high precepitation days. 

These are the last 12 months (up to 23 October 2017) figure of the percipitation in Hawaii

### Stations Analysis
There are 9 Weather Stations in Hawaii, with the most active station is USC00519281 Weather Station
The normal temperature data in USC00519281 are Min Temp = 54.0, Avg Temp = 71.7, Max Temp = 85.0

As can be seen in the graph below, most of the days in Station are in the comfortable weather between 70 - 80 degree F

## Climate App


## Temperature Analysis I
Both the graph and the statistical analysis below, it can be seem that Hawaii enjoy moderate temperature all year long, 
with average temperature difference between June and December only about 4 degrees F.

However to my surprise, the pvalue of the Ttest result is very low at 4.193529835915755e-187 

## Temperature Analysis II
This part analysing the temperature of a certain future holiday date, which I put as '2021-10-15' to '2021-11-05'
This challenge has 3 parts :
### Trip Average Temperature
Which calculate the average temperature (and the max and min) for the duration of the trip from the lastest year of the data

### Daily Normal Temperature
Which show the Max, Avg, and Min temperatures for each dates during the duration of the trip from the data 

### ### Daily Rainfall Average
Which calculate the rainfall for each weather stations for the duration of the trip using the previous year's matching dates.
